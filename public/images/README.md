# Images

Put your images into subfolders and reference them from `src/i18n/en.json` and `src/i18n/ru.json`.

Suggested structure:

- `public/images/people/you.jpg` (portrait, ~600–1200px, square-ish)
- `public/images/projects/alpha.jpg` (cover, ~1600×1000)
- `public/images/projects/beta.jpg`
- `public/images/projects/gamma.jpg`

The UI will show images only if `imageSrc` / `photoSrc` is non-empty.
